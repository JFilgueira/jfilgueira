## Hi there 👋
- 👨‍💻 Front-end | React student
- ☀️ Recife, Brasil
- 🖳 I’m currently studying and improving my front-end development skills with the React library!

## Wanna know a little about me?

In the year of 2022 I started to work with Wordpress websites because I needed to sustain the house. So I pass the first six months of that year working with it and learning a lot of lot of things, but the routine was very exausting because as the freelancer that I was, I didn't had a schedule rotune to work on, so worked and worked because the tasks needed to be done and I needed the money.

Was a tough time, but a yet a graceful time of my life.

So in the end of 2022 I decided that didn't want that kind of stresseful life for me and that I could made greater things for those that I need to care of, then I decided to learn how to really code.

With a lot of help of my greatest friends that support me emotionally and technically (when giving me acess to their Udemy accounts), they show me the path and I took it.

Even though not having university degrees, or even being studing in one, and knowing nothing of real coding at the time, I made the firm purpose to learn the main skill necessary to become a Junior Programmer until the end of 2023. 

And I did learn.

Went from basic HTML & CSS to doing Real Time Chat Application and User Role Menagement with Redux, everything being made with React.js. 

Now I come here to show to you some of my projects. And I hope you like what you see beucase I had a great time doing all of those things...

Have a great day!👋
