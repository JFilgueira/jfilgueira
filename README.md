## Hi there 👋
- 👨‍💻 Front-end | React student
- ☀️ Recife, Brasil
- 🖳 I’m currently studying and improving my front-end development skills with the React library!

## Wanna know a little about me?

In the year 2022, I started working with WordPress websites because I needed to sustain my household. So, I spent the first six months of that year working with it and learning a lot of things. However, the routine was very exhausting because, as a freelancer, I didn't have a scheduled routine to work on. I worked tirelessly because the tasks needed to be done, and I needed the money.

It was a tough time, but also a graceful period of my life.

At the end of 2022, I decided that I didn't want that kind of stressful life for myself, and I believed I could achieve greater things for those I needed to take care of. So, I decided to learn how to code.

With a lot of help from my greatest friends who supported me emotionally and technically (by giving me access to their Udemy accounts), they showed me the path, and I took it.

Even though I didn't have university degrees, or even enrolled in one, and knew nothing about real coding at the time, I made a firm commitment to learn the main skills necessary to become a Junior Programmer by the end of 2023.

And I did learn.

I went from basic HTML & CSS to creating a Real-Time Chat Application and User Role Management with Redux, all built with React.js.

Now I'm here to showcase some of my projects. I hope you like what you see because I had a great time working on all of those things.

Have a great day! 👋
